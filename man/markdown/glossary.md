# GLOSSARY

- **CTG**          : Master-Timing-Generator - Obsolete card replaced by MTT
- **CTIM**         : Central Timing - A timing event defined in the Central Timing
- **CTIM_Key**     : ???
- **CTIM_Virtual** : ???
- **CTR**          : (CTRV, CTRP, CTRI) Central Timing Receiver
- **FEC**          : Front End Computer. Computer running a (pseudo) real-time OS -typically Linux+rt-preempt- used to control equipment.
- **GMT**          : General Machine Timing
- **GPS**          : (1) Global Positioning System - Used to obtain precise timing (2) General Purpose Separator - an isotope separator in ISOLDE
- **LTIM**         : Local Timing - FESA class that interfaces with the CTRs
- **MTG**          : Machine Timing Generator
- **MTT**          : Multitasking timing generator (aka CTGMT ~ Multitask General Machine Timing Card)
- **PPM**          : Pulse-to-Pulse Modulation: Multiplexing where a property can take different values depending on the user
- **PPS**          : Pulse Per Second - A signal that pulses once per second. It comes from the GPS receiver and it's used when the higher frequency clocks would be inconvenient.
- **PTIM**         : Peripheral timing. Name of a (non-remote) timing configuration in the CTR.
- **TN**           : Technical Network. Restricted network where the FECs with control the accelerator's hardware (power converters, klystrons, beam instrumentation, etc.) are connected.- **GPN**          : General Purpose Network. 'Normal' network where office computers are connected to.
- **Telegram**     : Periodic information published on the GMT cable describing the context of the accelerator (particle type, destination, etc.).
- **TGM**          : see Telegram
